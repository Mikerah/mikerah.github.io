You've somehow stumbled upon my personal website so it warrants a bit of an introduction.

I'm Mikerah, I run a small crypto R&D consulting firm called [HashCloak](hashcloak.com) based in Toronto, Canada.

This site will be rarely updated if only to show my recent interests and memes about my dog.

If you find anything here interesting, then you can let me know via [X DMs](https://twitter.com/badcryptobitch)

If you've read of all of that and you do know me, then it's most likely for my [[Crypto Research]] stuff.
